    <h1>Week 01 Notes</h1>
    <ul style="max-width: 750px">
        <li>Computers are stupid and because of their stupidity, they cannot remember anything.</li>
        <li>Information stored or shared with the user is called output. Information coming in from where it is stored or information entered by the user is called input. (This is just a review and for me to remember)</li>
        <li>Input tag = a tag that allows the user to do input.</li>
        <li>Textarea = a bot that allows the user to enter text. (I actually need this one for a different class.)</li>
        <li>Make sure you always update the title of the page. (I always forget to do this so I am including it in my notes.)</li>
        <li>Section tags fill the screen all the way across. This is a good way to create breaks and make your page look neat instead of all spread out.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is going to be my main struggle in this class. Most of the time I feel like it is a foreign language.</li>
        <li>Variables in JavaScript are like a box you can put information in. Make sure to label the boxes. I like the example in the reading about kitchen containers and how they are labeled. That helped me to understand variables a little better.</li>
        <li>I actually understand getElementById, so I won't leave any notes about that.</li>
        <li>If you want to show something to the user you have to use a section and 'innerHTML'. If you are using an input or textarea use value; a section, use innerHTML. The reading says to not get these mixed up.</li>
        <li>'localStorage' stores what is in the variable and labels the stored information with what you find in the variable.</li>
        <li>JavaScript's local storage uses key-value pairs which basically means discription-stuff pairs.</li>
        <li>"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful."   -Joel Marsh</li>
        <li>You want to create a beautiful experience for your users so start small.</li>
        <li>We spent 30 years designing for one viewing device, but things are changing fast.</li>
        <li>There are several different devices with different screen sizes and resolutions. Our designs need to work with all of these devices.</li>
        <li>Mobile traffic from 2013 to 2014 went up nearly 20%.</li>
        <li>Responsive retrofitting-taking what you have and making it work on mobile. (DO NOT DO THIS!!!) Responsiveness is not mobile first</li>
        <li>Mobile First is time consuming and costly for a full rebuild, but worth it. Provides best experience across many devices. Addresses constraints of mobile size/bandwidth. Future friendly and ready for growth.</li>
        <li>"It is really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."  -Steve Jobs</li>
        <li>Be there to help your users. Answer questions and help move them along their decision journey. Be useful and satisify their needs. Be quick by not creating extra steps. Concentrate on how your user feels. Make sure you use correct reachability. Speed matters, reduce images or use SVG's, optimize and minify CSS and JS files, gzip files.</li>
        <li>"The trouble with software is...it sucks. That's not a nice thing to say...but it is a fundamental truth. Software customers--you, me, CIO's of multibillion-dolar companies...have learned to live with mediocre software. We do not count on software to be intuitively easy to understand or to work consistently. Instead, we make do."  -Stewart Alsop</li>
        <li>Think about putting the nav at the bottom of the screen to help your user with reachability. Many users do not know what a hamburger menu is.</li>
        <li>[The constraints of Mobile] push you toward more focused, simplified solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have to wait for it, and they're unlikely to give you their full attention. So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first. Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity.  -Luke Wroblewski</li>
        <li>Have labels sit inside boxes in forms and use float labels. Make checkboxes larger so your user can easily check the box. Make forms with the information needed only. If you have a large form include a progress bar. Enable auto complete. Show passwords all the time but keep the ability to hide them. Auto advance to the next field and use correct keyboard for the input required. Link phone numbers so users do not have to copy/paste.</li>
        <li>"End users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently marketers need to stay abreast not only of technological developments but also of the way people respond to them"  -Matt Haig</li>
        <li>Don't use popups! DON'T USE POPUPS! Make ads small and simple. Ad's can be clickable to show the enitre ad. You can also use a small ad that shows the entire ad when scrolled over. Users do not visit your site for ads.</li>
        <li>"The fallen state of our internet is a direct, if unintentional, consequence of choosing advertising as the default model to support online content and services."  -Ethan Zuckerman</li>
